# Booking App

A simple React-based booking form that allows users to select their check-in and check-out dates, room count, and submit the booking details. The app fetches mock data from a fake API endpoint to simulate the process of retrieving available booking data. It also includes basic error handling and loading state management.

## Features
- **Booking Form**: Users can select check-in and check-out dates, and choose the number of rooms.
- **Room Control**: Increment and decrement buttons to adjust the number of rooms.
- **API Simulation**: The app fetches mock data from a fake API to simulate available booking data (currently not displayed).
- **Error and Loading States**: Error messages for failed data fetch and loading indicators for API requests.
- **Booking Submission**: Booking data is submitted to a mock API endpoint and the user is redirected to a booking confirmation page.
